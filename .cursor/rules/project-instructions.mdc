# Project wide instructions

These are general instructions that aims to guide you (the LLM) to generate the
best possible output according to our preferences.

This repository is a monorepo, consisting of several packages, although autonomous relative to each other.

When asked to perform a task or solve a problem, please try to not generate any
more code than necessary to address the issue or solve the problem.

Try to keep the number of files affected by your code generation as low as possible.
If new, put many functions in the same file rather than scattering them
across the code base. Moving them to appropriate files will come in a later
instruction.

Avoid making assumptions and decisions about code that wasn't explicitly written out by the
prompter. If you are unsure, please ask first.
